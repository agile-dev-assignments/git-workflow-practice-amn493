## Article: [Writing Good Software Comments](https://www.brainstobytes.com/writing-good-software-comments-i/)

I found this article interesting because lots of software developers have trouble writing meaningful comments. They underestimate the importance of commenting when working with other developers. Comments should be present, but concise. They are meant to augment the code by breifly documenting its functionality. Writing code without comments makes it difficult to read and comprehend, both for the person who wrote it and other developers.
